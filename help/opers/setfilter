SETFILTER [server-mask] <check> { NEW | APPLY | +<data> }

Manages Hyperscan message filtering.

ENABLE activates filtering.

DISABLE deactivates filtering. It can be re-enabled with ENABLE.

DROP unloads the currently loaded Hyperscan database, if any.

ABORT cancels a database load operation started with NEW.

NEW prepares a buffer to accept a new Hyperscan database.

<data> is a base64 encoded chunk of a serialized hyperscan database.

APPLY deserialises the buffer and sets the resulting hyperscan database
as the one to use for filtering.

<check> can be any string and must be the same for all NEW, +<data>, and
APPLY commands for a single hyperscan database.
