MODE <channel> <+|-><b|q|e|I> $[~]<type>[:<data>]

Extended bans (ban conditionals) allow different checks than the usual
nick!user@host or nick!user@ip match to determine whether someone should
be banned, quieted, exempted or invited.

Extended bans are of the form $[~]<type>[:<data>]. The <type> is one
character (case insensitive) and determines the type of match. Most types
allow or require an extra field <data>. If the tilde (~) is present, the
result of the comparison will be negated, unless the ban is invalid in which
case it will never match. Invalid bans are ones where <data> is missing but
required or where <data> is otherwise invalid as noted below.

Unless noted below, all types can be used with +b, +q, +e and +I.
